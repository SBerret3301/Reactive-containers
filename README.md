Explanation:

1. **Title Modification:**
   - The title of the document is changed to "Responsive Containers."

2. **Bootstrap CSS and JS:**
   - The `<link>` tag is included to link the Bootstrap CSS file (`bootstrap.css`).
   - The `<script>` tag is included to link the Bootstrap JS file (`bootstrap.js`).

3. **Containers:**
   - A main container with padding top (`pt-3`) is used for the title and description.
   - Additional containers with different responsive classes (`container-sm`, `container-md`, `container-lg`, `container-xl`, `container-xxl`) are created for demonstration purposes.
   - Borders are added to visualize the containers.

4. **Comments:**
   - Comments are added to the code for better understanding of each section, Bootstrap classes used, and their purposes.

Note: Make sure to replace "bootstrap.css" and "bootstrap.js" with the correct paths to your Bootstrap CSS and JS files. If Bootstrap is not locally available, you can use CDN links like `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">` and `<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>`.
